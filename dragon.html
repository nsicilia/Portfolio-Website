            <p>
                Before getting started on any planning or designing, it was important to do background research in order to fully understand the context, culture, and location that our website would exist in. To do this, I read True Story of the 3 Little Pigs, The Three Pigs, and There‚Äôs a Wolf at the Door.

                Once we had a strong understanding of the culture of the community we were going to be working with, we created user personas to get a better representation of their needs that have to be addressed. We started brainstorming the ideas for which we could build a website around. The main goal of our website was to promote inclusivity and bring residents together.

                Once we had basic concepts mapped out we broke into our primary roles. My role as the lead developer entailed setting code formatting practices, establishing naming conventions, and compiling code modules into a cohesive experience. I was also responsible for creating a number of modules which included primary navigation, floating picture elements, and the around town facilities pages.

                Before creating the initial prototype I drew up sketches of potential site layouts. Because we wanted to convey information, I decided to sketch news websites. I created the low fidelity sketches to determine the best layout structure for the prototype.

                I believe our team did a really good job of working together, we all took on a fair amount of responsibility and handled it appropriately. All the members of Team 4 did an excellent job of meeting, and in many cases exceeding, the necessary criteria to complete tasks.
